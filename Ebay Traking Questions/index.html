              If your item hasn't arrived yet it may still be in transit, so the
              first thing to do is to check the delivery information. You can
              find your order's delivery information in your Purchase history.
              You'll be able see the item's expected delivery date, and the
              address it's being shipped to.

              What to do if your item is being delivered to the wrong address?

              If the shipping address you provided during checkout is incorrect,
              select Contact the seller on the order's delivery information page
              and see if they'll cancel the order. They can then relist the item
              for you to repurchase with the correct address. If the seller has
              already shipped the item, they won't be able to change the
              shipping address. If possible, we recommend trying to collect your
              package from the original address.

              If the seller offers to give you your money back, they have 2
              business days to issue your refund. When they do, you'll receive
              an email letting you know. It usually takes 3 to 5 business days
              for a PayPal refund to go through. If you paid with a credit card,
              it may take up to 30 days to process, depending on your card

              If your seller is using a tracked shipping service, you’ll be able
              to view carrier information as well as your order’s current
              location. If your item isn’t sent with tracking, you’ll be able to
              see the expected delivery date for your package.
